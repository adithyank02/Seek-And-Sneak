## Overview

** Seek And Sneak 3D ** is a multiplayer game built in **Unreal Engine** that reimagines the classic hide-and-seek genre. Players are split into two teams—**Hunters** and **Props**—each with unique abilities designed to create a more strategic and challenging experience. The goal for **Hunters** is to locate and eliminate the **Props**, while the **Props** must use their abilities to survive and evade capture until time runs out.

## Features

- **Multiplayer**: Built with Unreal Engine's Online Subsystem, enabling seamless **local multiplayer** over the same Wi-Fi network. Perfect for playing with friends in the same room.
- **Team-Based Gameplay**: Two teams—**Hunters** and **Props**—with different objectives:
  - **Hunters**: Find and eliminate all props before time expires.
  - **Props**: Survive and outsmart the hunters by evading capture until the timer runs out.
